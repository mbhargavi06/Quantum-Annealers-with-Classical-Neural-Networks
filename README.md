# Leveraging Neural Networks to Program Quantum Annealers

This project explores a hybrid approach that combines classical neural networks with quantum annealers to improve machine learning classification tasks. The primary objective is to leverage quantum annealing's potential to refine neural network outputs, enhancing classification accuracy.

## Project Overview

Quantum technologies are advancing rapidly, and this project investigates their potential in machine learning, particularly for classification tasks. The approach integrates classical neural networks to preprocess data and uses quantum annealers for fine-tuning the final states, leading to improved classification accuracy.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Applied normalization and feature scaling techniques to prepare input data.
2. **Classical Neural Network Setup:** Designed and trained a neural network to preprocess input data.
3. **Quantum Annealing:** The output of the neural network was used to set an initial state for the quantum annealer, which was then optimized using QAOA.
4. **Error Mitigation:** Applied Quantum Error Correction (QEC) techniques to minimize noise and errors during the quantum annealing process.
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Assessed the performance of the hybrid system using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR.

## Results

- **Accuracy Improvement:** The hybrid approach resulted in a significant improvement in classification accuracy, achieving a 7.6% increase compared to traditional methods.
- **Error Mitigation:** The application of QEC techniques reduced the impact of noise and errors, enhancing the reliability of the quantum annealer's output.

## Datasets Used
